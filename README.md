The problem I ran into was keeping track of and presenting course data for the client ABC University, including the course ID, title, and any prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approach the problem by modifying the CSV path within the IDE I was using. Understanding data structures is essential because they are the foundation of effective programming techniques, improve algorithmic thinking, optimize resource management, enhance problem-solving skills.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcome any issues I had with projects by looking up tutorials as well as a book I used a resource.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
While doing this project as well as the other projects in this course it made me have a better understanding as to why drawing up a flowchart or making a psuedocode is important for a project cause it gives you a better sense of how you want to write the program you're working on.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As stated in my last responce it made me realize the importance of a flowchart and a pseudocode, but also made me realize of the importance of a Big O notation.
